# XamarinSeed â€” the seed for xamarin mobile apps

This project is an application skeleton for a typical [Xamarin](http://xamarin.com/) mobile app.
You can use it to quickly bootstrap your xamarin mobile projects and dev environment for these
projects. This project is inspired from angular-seed.

The seed app doesn't do much, just shows how to wire a viewmodel and a view together.

## Getting Started

To get you started you can simply clone the XamarinSeed repository.

### Prerequisites

You need git to clone the XamarinSeed repository. You can get git from
[http://git-scm.com/](http://git-scm.com/).

You need Xamarin for Android too.

### Clone XamarinSeed

Clone the XamarinSeed repository using [git][git]:

```
git clone https://github.com/FredericDgrv/XamarinSeed.git
cd XamarinSeed
```

If you just want to start a new project without the angular-seed commit history then you can do:

```bash
git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/FredericDgrv/XamarinSeed.git <your-project-name>
```

The `depth=1` tells git to only pull down one commit worth of historical data.
